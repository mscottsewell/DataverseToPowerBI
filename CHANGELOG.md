## [Unreleased] — Code Review Fixes

### Fixed

- **Description Preservation in TMDL** — `WriteTmdlFile` no longer strips `description:` properties from table and column TMDL files. The regex removal is now scoped to `relationships.tmdl` only, where Power BI Desktop (Feb 2026) rejects descriptions. User-authored descriptions on columns, tables, and measures now survive incremental regeneration.

- **Null Safety in IsLookupType** — `IsLookupType()` and `IsPolymorphicLookupType()` now use `string.Equals()` static method instead of instance `.Equals()` on a nullable parameter, preventing potential `NullReferenceException`.

### Changed

- **FetchXML Debug Logs Opt-In** — FetchXML conversion debug files (`FetchXML_Debug/` folder) are no longer written to the output folder on every build. Debug logging is now gated behind an opt-in `enableFetchXmlDebugLogs` constructor parameter (default: `false`). This prevents sensitive view filter data from persisting to disk and reduces unnecessary I/O.

- **Lineage Stability Across Display Name Renames** — Column lineage tags are now backed by a stable `DataverseToPowerBI_LogicalName` annotation. When a Dataverse display name changes, the lineage tag is preserved via the logical name fallback, preventing Power BI from treating renamed columns as new (which would break existing report visuals).

- **ExtractEnvironmentName Deduplicated** — Consolidated the duplicated `ExtractEnvironmentName()` method (previously in both `PluginControl.cs` and `SemanticModelBuilder.cs`) into a shared `UrlHelper` static class.

### Added

- **FetchXmlToSqlConverter C# Tests** — Added 28 unit tests covering all operator categories: basic comparison, null, string, date (timezone-adjusted), list (in/not-in), filter logic (AND/OR/nested), user context operators (TDS vs FabricLink vs Import mode), link-entity subqueries, and edge cases (empty XML, invalid XML, custom alias).

- **Incremental Update Integration Tests** — Added 12 integration tests for lineage preservation with logical name fallback, column metadata fallback, description survival, user measure preservation, and annotation preservation.

### Removed

- **PPTB (Power Platform Toolbox) Port** — Removed the experimental `DataverseToPowerBI.PPTB` TypeScript/React project. The port requires significant rework before it would be usable. Code is preserved in git history for potential future revival.

## [1.2026.5.101] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Lookup Sub-Column Configuration** — Per-lookup control over which generated sub-columns (ID/GUID, Name, Type, Yomi) are included or hidden in the semantic model. New `LookupSubColumnConfig` model with nullable boolean fields; null values fall through to smart defaults based on relationship status:
  - Lookups in a relationship default to: ID=Included+Hidden, Name=Excluded
  - Lookups not in a relationship default to: ID=Excluded, Name=Included
  - Owner/Customer polymorphic lookups additionally expose Type and Yomi sub-columns
  - Include/Hidden toggles appear as clickable `☑`/`☐` text checkboxes in the attribute list
  - Configurations persisted per semantic model and restored on load

- **Collapsible Lookup Groups** — Lookup attributes in the attribute list now render as expandable/collapsible groups with `▼`/`▶` toggle headers. Click the display name to collapse/expand sub-rows. Expanded lookup child rows appear nested under the group header.

- **Polymorphic Lookup Support (Owner/Customer)** — Full support for Owner and Customer polymorphic lookup types:
  - Type (`{lookup}type`) and Yomi (`{lookup}yominame`) sub-columns exposed as toggleable rows
  - Virtual sub-columns (e.g., `owneridname`, `owneridtype`, `owneridyominame`) automatically filtered from the main attribute list to prevent duplicate selection
  - Migration logic upgrades previously-selected polymorphic virtual columns into the new sub-column config system
  - TMDL generation, M query, and expected column calculations all updated to conditionally include/exclude each sub-column

- **Cross-Chain Ambiguity Detection** — The Fact/Dimension selector now detects when the same dimension table is reachable via multiple active relationship paths from different source tables (e.g., Contact as both a direct dimension and a snowflake off Account). Amber/orange highlighting distinguishes cross-chain conflicts from same-source conflicts (red). A warning dialog on Finish prompts the user to resolve ambiguous paths.

- **Source Table Column in Relationship Selector** — New "Source Table" column added to the Fact/Dimension selector ListView, making it clear which table each lookup originates from. Particularly useful when snowflake relationships introduce lookups from multiple source tables. Dialog widened from 900px to 980px to accommodate.

- **Dimension Chain Grouping** — Relationships in the Fact/Dimension selector are now grouped by dimension chain rather than just target table. Direct dimensions and their snowflake descendants form a single visual group, with items sorted by lineage order (direct → snowflake L1 → snowflake L2). Group headers reflect the chain structure.

- **Snowflake Table Tracking** — Snowflake dimension targets that aren't in the current solution are now tracked in a separate `_snowflakeAddedTables` list, enabling deeper snowflake chaining (Fact → Dim → Snowflake → Snowflake2). `FindTableByLogicalName()` searches both solution and snowflake-added tables.

- **Lookup Sub-Column Unit Tests** — 378 lines of new xUnit tests covering lookup sub-column configuration behavior in TMDL generation: ID include/exclude, Name include/exclude, polymorphic type/yomi columns, hidden flag propagation, and interaction with relationship-required columns.

### Changed

- **Attribute List Column Headers** — Renamed abbreviated "Incl" and "Hid" column headers to full "Include" and "Hidden" labels for clarity. Rebalanced column widths across the attribute grid (Default, Type, and Expand columns reduced proportionally to accommodate the wider labels).

- **Lookup Sub-Row Checkbox Cleanup** — The "Sel" checkbox column no longer renders empty, non-functional checkboxes on lookup sub-rows (sublookup child rows and expanded lookup child rows). Uses native Win32 `LVM_SETITEM` to selectively hide the state image on rows where selection is managed via the Include/Hidden toggles instead.

- **Expand Lookup Always Enabled** — Removed `FeatureFlags.EnableExpandLookup` experimental gate. The Expand Lookup feature is now always available for all Lookup, Owner, and Customer attribute types.

- **TMDL Lookup Column Generation Overhaul** — `GenerateTableTmdl()`, `GenerateMQuery()`, and `GenerateExpectedColumns()` refactored to use `ResolveLookupSubColumnFlags()` for consistent, config-driven lookup sub-column generation. Each sub-column (ID, Name, Type, Yomi) is conditionally included/excluded and marked hidden based on the per-lookup config. Replaces the previous behavior of always emitting both ID (hidden) and Name (visible) columns.

- **User-Added Relationship Marker** — Preserved user relationships in TMDL output now include a `/// User-added relationship (preserved by DataverseToPowerBI)` comment marker if not already present, making it clear which relationships were manually added vs. tool-generated.

- **Auto-Check Prevention on Re-Edit** — When re-opening the Fact/Dimension selector for an existing fact table, relationships are no longer auto-checked. Only first-time setup or switching to a different fact table triggers auto-selection, preventing the tool from re-adding relationships the user previously removed.

- **Select All / Deselect All Safety** — Select All and Deselect All now skip internal sub-rows (`__sublookup__` and `__expanded__` tags), preventing synthetic sub-row tags from being added to `_selectedAttributes`.

### Fixed

- **Relationship Lookup GUID Auto-Defaults** — When adding a dimension relationship (e.g., Case → Product via `productid`), the lookup's GUID/ID sub-column is now correctly defaulted to Include=true and Hidden=true. Previously, stale explicit `LookupSubColumnConfig` entries (created when toggling any sub-column before the relationship existed) could override the smart defaults, leaving the foreign key column excluded.

- **Relationship-Required Columns in Build Output** — `PrepareExportData()` now includes relationship-required lookup columns in the exported attribute list, matching the display behavior. Previously, if a lookup column was required by a relationship but not explicitly in `_selectedAttributes`, it could be omitted from the TMDL build output.

- **Relationship-Required Columns Auto-Selected** — Lookup columns required by relationships are now automatically added to `_selectedAttributes` during metadata load (alongside primary key and primary name attributes). Ensures consistent state between the UI display and the underlying selection model.

- **Relationship GUID Include Lock** — The Include checkbox on the GUID/ID sub-row is now read-only (grayed, click-ignored) when the parent lookup supports a defined relationship. The foreign key column cannot be accidentally excluded while the dimension table is part of the model; the Hidden toggle remains editable.

- **Cross-Chain Relationship Status Refresh** — Checking, unchecking, or double-clicking a relationship now refreshes the status display for ALL relationships sharing the same target table (including cross-chain items from different source tables), not just same-source items. Prevents stale status/highlighting when relationships from multiple chains point to the same dimension.

- **Polymorphic Virtual Column Filtering** — `GenerateTableTmdl()`, `GenerateMQuery()`, and `GenerateExpectedColumns()` now skip polymorphic virtual sub-columns (e.g., `owneridname`, `customeridtype`) that are handled by the parent lookup's sub-column config. Prevents duplicate columns in the generated output when both the virtual column and its parent lookup are selected.

---

## [1.2026.5.84] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Expanded Lookup SQL JOIN Table Name Resolution** — Expanded-lookup JOINs now always use the related table logical/schema name instead of display name, preventing invalid SQL when a selected view includes related-table columns.

---

## [1.2026.5.83] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **View-Based Expanded Field Defaults (Strict Matching)** — The `Default` checkmark for expanded child rows now appears only when a child field matches the currently selected view's linked columns (lookup + target table + attribute). Manually edited expanded rows are no longer treated as view-defaults unless they exactly match the selected view definition.

- **Expanded Lookup Metadata Normalization on Load** — Existing saved expanded lookup settings are auto-upgraded during metadata load/revalidation:
  - Replaces legacy placeholder display names with resolved Dataverse display names
  - Refreshes target table display names
  - Refreshes attribute metadata (type/schema/targets/virtual attribute)
  - Persists upgraded values automatically so users do not need to reselect views

### Changed

- **Quick Select UX (Paste Attributes Dialog)** — Applying Quick Select now preserves the current attribute filter mode (`All` or `Selected`) instead of switching users to `All`.

- **Quick Select Refresh Behavior** — After applying quick-selected attributes, the attribute list refreshes in-place so newly selected attributes are immediately visible in the current mode.

- **Selection Persistence Reliability** — Selected attribute sets are now handled with case-insensitive comparison when restored/initialized, preventing saved selections from appearing unchecked after close/reopen due to casing differences.

### Fixed

- **Saved Selections Lost on Reopen (View Mode)** — Removed load/revalidation behavior that reapplied default field selection and could overwrite user-selected attributes. Revalidation now updates metadata/default indicators without resetting saved `Selected` values (except for valid cleanup of attributes that no longer exist and required locked fields).

---

## [1.2026.5.62] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **FabricLink Expanded Multi-Select Label Resolution** — Expanded multi-select choice fields in FabricLink mode now use `OUTER APPLY` with `STRING_SPLIT` / `STRING_AGG` and metadata JOINs, matching the label resolution pattern used by regular multi-select fields. Previously, expanded multi-select fields referenced a non-existent `name` column from the joined table, which could return raw integer values instead of localized labels.

---

## [1.2026.5.61] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Expand Lookups (Denormalization)** — Pull attributes from related tables directly into a parent table's query via LEFT OUTER JOIN, without adding a full dimension table
  - Click ⊚ on any lookup attribute to open the Expand Lookup dialog
  - Select attributes from the related table's form; checked attributes appear as child rows under the lookup field
  - Type-aware SQL generation: lookups select the name column, choices/booleans use virtual name columns (TDS) or metadata JOINs (FabricLink), multi-select choices handled with the same pattern
  - Display names use "{TargetTable} : {AttributeDisplayName}" convention
  - Expanded lookup configurations are persisted per semantic model and restored on load
  - Allow zero selections to remove an expansion
  - Marked as experimental — LEFT OUTER JOINs may affect DirectQuery performance on large tables

- **CSV Documentation Export** — Export semantic model configuration as human-readable CSV files for review and audit
  - Generates Summary.csv, Tables.csv, Attributes.csv, Relationships.csv, and ExpandedLookups.csv
  - Per-table selection dialog — choose which tables to include in the documentation
  - RFC 4180 compliant CSV formatting
  - Export-only (not importable); JSON export/import remains for full round-trip configuration sharing

### Changed

- **Export Flow Redesign** — Export button now prompts for format (JSON or CSV) before proceeding
  - JSON: exports the complete model configuration directly (full schema, importable)
  - CSV: opens a table selection dialog, then exports filtered CSV documentation to a named subfolder
  - Replaces the previous single-format JSON-only export

---

## [1.2026.5.60] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **FabricLink Multi-Select Choice Resolution** — Fixed metadata join behavior for multi-select choice fields in FabricLink SQL generation
  - Uses semicolon delimiter (`;`) in `STRING_SPLIT` for Dataverse multi-select values (instead of comma)
  - Uses the attribute logical name for `OptionSetName` in metadata joins (instead of the choice definition name)
  - Applied consistently to both generated SQL and query-comparison logic to prevent false change detection

---

## [1.2026.5.37] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- **TMDL Description Property Compatibility** — Fixed Power BI Desktop schema validation errors caused by `description` properties on relationships
  - Power BI Desktop (Feb 2026) rejects TMDL files containing description properties in relationship blocks
  - Added `SanitizeRelationshipBlock()` and `SanitizeRelationshipsTmdl()` methods to strip unsupported properties
  - Global TMDL sanitization in `WriteTmdlFile()` removes description properties from all generated files
  - Prevents "relationship schema validation failed" errors when opening PBIP projects

- **Ambiguous Relationship Path Resolution** — Automatically resolves conflicts when multiple active relationships exist between same source→target table pair
  - Added `ResolveAmbiguousRelationshipPaths()` method that marks extra active relationships as inactive
  - Only one active relationship allowed per source→target path (Power BI requirement)
  - Logs resolved conflicts to debug output for transparency
  - Prevents "ambiguous relationship path" errors in Power BI Desktop

- **Relationship Dialog Null Reference Crashes** — Fixed `NullReferenceException` when checking/unchecking relationships in Fact/Dimension selector
  - Added comprehensive null checks throughout `ListViewRelationships_ItemChecked` event handler
  - Added null guards to all LINQ queries accessing `_allRelationshipItems` collection
  - Fixed iteration safeguards in `UpdateItemStatus`, `FilterRelationships`, and `BtnFinish_Click`
  - Applied same fixes to snowflake dimension selector dialog (`SnowflakeDimensionForm`)

- **Relationship State Tracking** — Fixed relationship active/inactive state determination using incorrect ListView.Checked property
  - Added `IsChecked` property to `RelationshipTag` and `SnowflakeTag` classes
  - State now tracked in tag object instead of relying on ListView control state
  - Prevents race conditions when items are filtered out of view but still logically selected
  - Fixed conflict detection to use `IsChecked` from tag for accurate state determination

- **Out-of-Solution Relationship Filtering** — Fixed "Solution tables only" filter hiding already-selected relationships to tables outside solution
  - Filter now preserves relationships that are already checked/selected
  - Only hides unselected relationships to out-of-solution tables
  - Prevents accidental loss of snowflake dimension selections when toggling filter

- **Duplicate Partition Mode Declaration** — Fixed duplicate `mode:` line appearing in generated table partition TMDL
  - Removed redundant `sb.AppendLine($"\t\tmode: {GetPartitionMode(table.Role, table.LogicalName)}");` statement
  - TMDL now contains single partition mode declaration per table

- **Relationship Ambiguity User Prompts** — Added confirmation dialogs when selecting relationships that conflict with existing active relationships
  - User can choose to keep newly selected relationship active or existing one
  - Applied to both checkbox selection and double-click activation
  - Prevents silent relationship state changes that could break DAX measures

## [1.2026.5.24] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Storage Mode Support** — Full storage mode selection for semantic models: Direct Query, Dual - All Dimensions, Dual - Select Tables, and Import
  - **Direct Query**: All tables use `directQuery` partition mode (existing default behavior)
  - **Dual - All Dimensions**: Fact tables remain `directQuery`, all dimension tables use `dual` mode
  - **Dual - Select Tables**: Per-table storage mode overrides — individually toggle dimension tables between `directQuery` and `dual`
  - **Import**: All Dataverse/FabricLink tables use `import` mode; automatically deletes `cache.abf` when switching away from Import
  - Storage mode persisted per semantic model configuration
  - Auto-strips `current_user` view filters when appropriate (Import: always; Dual: on dimensions; DualSelect: on dual tables)

- **Per-Table Storage Mode Editing** — Mode column in Selected Tables list shows each table's storage mode
  - Always visible with values: "Direct Query", "Dual", or "Import"
  - Click a dimension table's Mode cell to toggle between Direct Query ↔ Dual

  - Enables sharing configurations between machines or team members

- **Incremental Update Preservation** — Comprehensive preservation of user customizations during model rebuilds
  - **LineageTag preservation**: Table, column, measure, expression, and relationship lineageTags preserved across updates — report visuals and refresh history stay connected
  - **User relationship preservation**: Relationships not matching Dataverse metadata detected and preserved with `/// User-added relationship` marker
  - **Column description preservation**: User-edited descriptions (those not matching the tool's `Source:` pattern) preserved; tool descriptions regenerated
  - **Column formatting preservation**: User changes to `formatString` and `summarizeBy` preserved when column data type is unchanged
  - **User annotation preservation**: Custom annotations on columns preserved; tool annotations (`SummarizationSetBy`, `UnderlyingDateTimeDataType`) regenerated
  - **Platform ID preservation**: `.platform` file logical IDs preserved during incremental updates

- **Table Rename Detection** — Detects table display name changes via `/// Source:` comment in TMDL files
  - LineageTags, user measures, and column metadata carried over from old file
  - Old file automatically deleted after successful migration

- **Date Relationship Dedup** — Stale date→Date.Date relationships automatically cleaned up when date field configuration changes
  - Prevents old date relationships from being preserved as "user-added"

- **Connection Type Change Warnings** — AnalyzeChanges now warns when connection type differs between existing model and new configuration (TDS↔FabricLink)

- **Redesigned Change Preview Dialog** — Complete redesign of the pre-build change preview
  - **Grouped TreeView**: Changes organized under ⚠ Warnings, 📋 Tables, 🔗 Relationships, 🔌 Data Sources

  - Full navigation, search, breadcrumb bar, and favorites pane
  - Applied to all 4 folder selection locations (Working Folder and PBIP Template in both Manager and New Model dialogs)

- **Attribute List Performance** — Pre-built sorted attribute cache during metadata loading
  - Attributes sorted once during refresh, cached for instant display when switching tables or filter modes
  - Uses `Items.AddRange()` batch insertion instead of individual adds
  - Added `_isLoading` guard to prevent `ItemChecked` events from corrupting selection state during list population

- **Unit Test Project** — 43 xUnit tests covering preservation logic

  - Storage Mode moved above Connection Type in details panel
  - Last Used column now shows date-only (was date+time) to prevent truncation
  - Column widths optimized to fit within list pane without horizontal scrolling

- **Selected Tables Column Widths** — Adjusted for better proportions: Table=90, Mode=90, Form=90, Filter=100, Attrs=30
  - Fixed `ResizeTableColumns()` resize handler to respect new proportions (was overriding Designer widths)
  - Mode column included in proportional resize calculations

- **Storage Mode Comparison** — Added `NormalizeStorageMode()` to treat "Dual" and "DualSelect" as equivalent
  - Prevents false storage mode change warnings when rebuilding without changes

- **Boolean Field Query Comparison** — `GenerateMQuery` now uses `GlobalOptionsetMetadata` for Boolean fields
  - Matches `GenerateTableTmdl` behavior; eliminates false "query structure changed" warnings

### Fixed

- **Relationship Active/Inactive Normalization** — Fixed unchecked relationships incorrectly showing "Active" status
  - When unchecking a relationship, Active/Inactive states are now normalized for that dimension
  - If exactly one relationship to a dimension remains checked, it's automatically set to Active and all others to Inactive
  - If zero relationships remain checked, all are marked Active (ready for user to select whichever one they want)
  - If multiple remain checked, first one is automatically set to Active and others to Inactive (user can double-click another to change which is Active)
  - Double-clicking any relationship toggles it to Active and automatically marks all others to that dimension as Inactive
  - Applied to both main Fact/Dimension selector and "Add Parent Tables" snowflake dialog

- **Collection Modification Exception** — Fixed crash when reopening relationship dialog after filtering by solution tables
  - Added safety checks to `FilterRelationships()` to prevent manipulation during form disposal

  - Unchecked relationships are ignored for conflict detection even if they have `IsActive = true`
  - Applied to both main Fact/Dimension selector and "Add Parent Tables" snowflake dialog

- **DATEDIFF Bug in FetchXML Converter** — Fixed `older-than-x-*` operators passing integer where date expression was expected
  - `DATEDIFF(day, column, 30)` → `DATEDIFF(day, column, GETDATE()) > 30`

- **Date Table Relationship Display Names** — Date table relationships now honor user display name overrides
  - Previously used logical name even when display name alias was configured

- **Font GDI Resource Leaks** — Cached Font objects in `PluginControl` and `TmdlPreviewDialog` to prevent GDI handle exhaustion
  - Added proper `Dispose` overrides to clean up cached fonts

- **False Storage Mode Warning** — Fixed spurious "Changing from Dual to DualSelect" warning on immediate rebuild
  - Both modes produce identical TMDL output and are now treated as equivalent

- **False Query Change Warning** — Fixed spurious "query structure changed" for tables with Boolean fields in FabricLink mode
  - `GenerateMQuery` now correctly uses `GlobalOptionsetMetadata` for Boolean attributes

---

## [1.2026.5.1] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Visual Grouping for Multiple Relationships** — Dimensions with multiple relationships are now visually grouped in the relationship selector
  - Group headers display dimension name with "(Multiple Relationships)" label
  - Only tables with 2+ relationships are grouped; single relationships remain ungrouped for clarity
  - Applied to both main Fact/Dimension selector dialog and "Add Parent Tables" snowflake dialog
  - Makes it easier to identify which relationships belong to the same dimension

- **Solution Tables Filter** — Added "Solution tables only" checkbox next to Solution dropdown
  - Enabled by default to show only relationships to tables in the current solution
  - Unchecking shows relationships to all tables (including those outside the solution)
  - Works seamlessly with search filter
  - Reduces clutter when working with specific solutions

- **Relationship Search** — Added search box to filter relationships by field names and dimension table names
  - Real-time filtering as you type
  - Searches across: Lookup Field name, Lookup Logical Name, Target Table name, Target Logical Name
  - Validation still checks all relationships (not just filtered ones)
  - Preserves checked state when filtering

### Changed

- **Default Relationship Status** — All relationships now default to "Active" status
  - Previous behavior: Multi-relationship dimensions defaulted to "Inactive"
  - New behavior: All relationships start as "Active" for clearer initial state
  - Users explicitly choose which relationship to make inactive when multiple exist

- **Smart Relationship Selection** — Enhanced automatic inactivation when selecting relationships
  - Checking a relationship automatically marks ALL other relationships to that same dimension as "Inactive"
  - Applied whether the other relationships are checked or not
  - Double-clicking a relationship to make it Active automatically inactivates all others to that dimension
  - Prevents conflicts and ensures only one active relationship per dimension

- **Column Width Optimization** — Adjusted column widths for better data visibility
  - **Main grid (Selected Tables & Forms)**: Type column increased from 100px to 140px; Filter column now gets 50% of flexible space (up from 33.33%)
  - **Main grid (Attributes)**: Type column increased from 100px to 140px to prevent truncation of "Uniqueidentifier" and other long type names
  - **Fact/Dimension Selector**: Reduced width from 1050px to 900px (150px narrower); column widths adjusted to fit
  - **Add Parent Tables dialog**: Lookup Field and Parent Table columns reduced to 150px (75% of original 200px) to fit Logical Name column without scrolling

- **Dialog Layout Improvements** — Reorganized Fact/Dimension selector for better usability
  - "Include one-to-many relationships" checkbox moved to left (first position)
  - Search box moved to far right, aligned with grid's right edge
  - Finish and Cancel buttons repositioned to remain fully visible at new dialog width

- **Improved Relationship Conflict Highlighting** — Enhanced visual indicators for relationship status
  - Type column now displays "(Inactive)" suffix for inactive relationships (e.g., "Direct (Inactive)")
  - Red highlighting (light salmon) now only appears when multiple ACTIVE relationships exist to the same dimension (conflict state)
  - Inactive relationships no longer highlighted — clean white background for clarity
  - Applied to both main Fact/Dimension selector and "Add Parent Tables" snowflake dialog
  - Makes it immediately clear which relationships have conflicts vs. which are safely inactive

### Fixed

- **NullReferenceException in ItemChecked Event** — Fixed crash when opening Fact/Dimension selector dialog
  - Added `_suppressItemCheckedEvent` flag to prevent events during list manipulation
  - Added comprehensive null checks in all event handlers (`ItemChecked`, `DoubleClick`, `UpdateItemStatus`, `UpdateSnowflakeButtonState`)
  - Protected LINQ queries with `.Where(i => i.Tag != null)` filters
  - Fixed iteration to use `_allRelationshipItems` instead of `listViewRelationships.Items` for complete coverage
  - Applied same safety features to snowflake "Add Parent Tables" dialog

- **FabricLink Current User Filter** — FetchXML filters with current user operators now handled correctly for FabricLink
  - User context operators (`eq-userid`, `ne-userid`, `eq-userteams`, `ne-userteams`) are now skipped in FabricLink mode
  - These operators continue to work with DataverseTDS connection mode
  - Skipped operators are logged as "not supported in FabricLink (use TDS for current user filters)"
  - Prevents SQL syntax errors in Direct Lake scenarios that don't support `CURRENT_USER` constructs
  - Debug logs clearly indicate which operators were skipped due to FabricLink limitations

  - Example: `"contact.donotsendmmname" → "donotsendmarketingmaterial"`
  - Prevents SQL errors from bad metadata by applying corrections automatically
  - Applied across all three generation methods (TMDL export, change analysis, comparison queries)
  - Add new corrections to `VirtualColumnCorrections` dictionary in `SemanticModelBuilder.cs`

- **Enhanced Column Descriptions** — TMDL column descriptions now include comprehensive metadata
  - **Dataverse Description**: User-provided description from attribute metadata (if available) shown first
  - **Source Attribution**: `Source: {tableLogicalName}.{attributeLogicalName}` format for clear data lineage
  - **Lookup Targets**: Target table names for lookup/polymorphic lookup columns
  - Example: `"The primary contact for the account | Source: account.primarycontactid | Targets: contact"`
  - Applied to all column types (regular, lookup, choice/boolean, multi-select, primary keys, relationship-required lookups)
  - `Description` property added to `AttributeMetadata` model, populated from XRM SDK metadata
  - `BuildDescription()` method refactored to accept table/attribute names and Dataverse description

### Changed

- **TMDL Preview Sort Order** — Reordered preview list for better usability and logical flow
  - **New order**: Fact Tables → Dimension Tables → Date Table → Expressions (alphabetically within each category)
  - **Previous order**: Expressions → Date Table → Fact Table → Dimension Tables
  - `TmdlEntryType` enum values changed: `FactTable=0, DimensionTable=1, DateTable=2, Expression=3`
  - More intuitive for users to find their primary data tables first

- **TMDL Preview SQL Formatting** — Fixed line breaks in Windows Forms TextBox display
  - Replaced all embedded `\n` (LF) with `\r\n` (CRLF) in SQL SELECT list, JOIN clauses, and OUTER APPLY subqueries
  - Windows Forms TextBox requires CRLF for proper line rendering (LF-only appears on same line)
  - Affected areas: SELECT field continuation, State/Status/Boolean/Picklist JOINs, multi-select OUTER APPLY
  - Fixed: `FROM {table} as Base` → `FROM {table} AS Base` (uppercase AS for consistency)

- **UseDisplayNameAliasesInSql Default Handling** — Added `[OnDeserializing]` callback to ensure correct default value
  - `DataContractJsonSerializer` bypasses constructors and property initializers
  - Models saved before the aliasing feature existed were loading with `false` instead of declared `true` default
  - `SetDefaults()` method in `SemanticModelConfig` sets `UseDisplayNameAliasesInSql = true` before deserialization

### Fixed

- **PrepareExportData Bug Fixes** — Critical metadata propagation issues resolved
  - `HasStateCode` now correctly set on `ExportTable` by checking if `_tableAttributes` contains `statecode` attribute
  - `IsGlobal` and `OptionSetName` now copied from `AttributeMetadata` to `AttributeDisplayInfo`
  - Prevents missing WHERE clause in SQL queries (when `HasStateCode` was false incorrectly)
  - Ensures FabricLink JOINs use correct metadata table (`GlobalOptionsetMetadata` vs `OptionsetMetadata`)

- **Build Warnings Eliminated** — Removed all NuGet package conflicts and nullable reference warnings
  - Fixed 2× MSB3277 assembly version conflicts (System.ValueTuple, System.Text.Json)
  - Fixed 6× CS8618 non-nullable field warnings in `TmdlPreviewDialog.cs` (added `= null!` initialization)
  - Removed `System.ValueTuple` NuGet package (built into .NET Framework 4.8)
  - Upgraded `System.Text.Json` from 8.0.0 to 8.0.5 (then removed entirely as unused)
  - Removed ALL 17 unused NuGet packages left from deleted `SqlQueryValidator` (Azure.Identity, Azure.Core, Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, etc.)
  - Emptied `packages.config` and deleted all package folders
  - **Build now succeeds with 0 warnings and 0 errors**

## [1.2026.4.10] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **TMDL Preview Feature** — Replaced "View SQL" with "Preview TMDL" showing the exact TMDL statements that will be written to the semantic model
  - Displays sorted preview list with automatic categorization: Expressions → Date Table → Fact Table → Dimensions (alphabetically)
  - **Connection Mode Awareness**: 
    - TDS mode: Shows "DataverseURL" parameter table as Expression type
    - FabricLink mode: Shows both "Expressions" (FabricSQLEndpoint + FabricLakehouse parameters) and "DataverseURL" table
  - **Date Table Integration**: Date table entry appears automatically if configured, positioned after Expressions and before data tables; omitted if date table is not configured
  - **Preview-to-Build Consistency**: Output is identical to actual build — uses the real `SemanticModelBuilder.GenerateTmdlPreview()` API instead of divergent inline generation
  - Visual distinction by entry type: italic blue text for Config/Date entries, bold for Fact table, normal for Dimensions
  - Type labels in second column: "Config", "Date", "Fact", "Dimension"
  - **Export Capabilities**:
    - Copy selected TMDL to clipboard with one click
    - Save individual `.tmdl` file with sanitized filename based on entry name
    - Save All button exports all entries as separate `.tmdl` files to chosen folder
  - Full TMDL content with UTF-8 encoding (no BOM): complete table declarations, column definitions with data types, measures, hierarchies, and M partition expressions

- **Display Name Aliases in SQL** — Columns can now use display names as SQL aliases (`AS [Display Name]`) for human-readable column names in the semantic model
  - **Per-model toggle**: "Use Display Name Aliases in SQL" checkbox in Semantic Model Settings (enabled by default for new models)
  - **Per-attribute override**: Double-click the Display Name column in the attributes list to set a custom alias for any column; setting it back to the original removes the override
  - **Auto-override for primary name attributes**: Primary name columns automatically get "{Table Name} {Column Name}" aliases to avoid duplicates across tables (e.g., "Account Name" instead of "Name")
  - **Duplicate detection**: Conflicting display name aliases are highlighted in light red in the attributes list; build and preview are blocked with a descriptive error listing all conflicts
  - **Override indicators**: Overridden display names show an asterisk (*) suffix in the attributes list
  - **Full TMDL integration**: Aliases are applied consistently across `GenerateTableTmdl`, `GenerateMQuery`, and `GenerateExpectedColumns` for all column types (regular, lookup, choice/boolean, multi-select, datetime-wrapped)
  - **Settings persistence**: Overrides are saved per-table and restored when loading a semantic model

### Changed

- **SQL Preview → TMDL Preview** — Renamed toolbar button from "Validate SQL" (btnValidateSql) to "Preview TMDL" (btnPreviewTmdl)
  - Shows actual TMDL output that matches the build output exactly
  - No longer shows divergent inline SQL generation (eliminated ~200 lines of out-of-sync code)
  - Uses the real `SemanticModelBuilder.GenerateTmdlPreview()` API instead of duplicated preview logic

- **SemanticModelBuilder Refactoring** — Extracted reusable components for preview generation
  - Added public `GenerateTmdlPreview()` method to generate full TMDL preview with all entry types
  - Extracted private `GenerateDataverseUrlTableTmdl()` method to decouple content generation from file I/O
  - `WriteDataverseUrlTable()` now calls the extracted method for content generation

- **Build Pipeline Optimization** — Extracted `PrepareExportData()` helper in PluginControl
  - Shared method builds `exportTables`, `exportRelationships`, and `attributeDisplayInfo` structures
  - Used by both incremental build (`BuildSemanticModel`) and TMDL preview flows
  - Eliminates code duplication for export data preparation

### Removed

- **Obsolete SQL Validation Infrastructure** — Removed all dependencies and code related to the old SQL validation feature:
  - Deleted `SqlQueryValidator.cs` service class
  - Deleted `SqlQueryValidationDialog.cs` form (replaced by `TmdlPreviewDialog.cs`)
  - Removed NuGet package references: Azure.Identity, Azure.Core, Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, Microsoft.Identity.Client, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Abstractions, System.Memory.Data, Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal
  - Deleted entire `packages/` folder containing NuGet assemblies
  - Reduced project bloat by ~350 MB of unused dependencies

---

## [1.2026.3.10] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Pre-Build Integrity Validation** — Automatic detection of incomplete PBIP structures before incremental builds
  - Validates presence of critical files: `.pbip`, `.platform`, `definition.pbism`, `model.tmdl`, `tables/` folder, Report folder
  - If structural files are missing, automatically performs full rebuild instead of failing on incremental update
  - Adds Warning-type changes to preview dialog showing each missing element
  - Prevents `DirectoryNotFoundException` and other build failures from corrupted project folders

- **Relationship-Required Column Locking** — Lookup fields used by active relationships are now automatically locked in the attribute selection UI
  - Lookup columns required for dimension relationships cannot be unchecked while the target dimension is in the model
  - Shows 🔒 icon with blue/bold styling for locked relationship columns
  - Survives metadata refresh and deselect-all operations
  - Prevents relationship breakage from accidental column deselection

- **FabricLink Connection Mode** — Full support for building semantic models that query Dataverse data via Microsoft Fabric Link (Lakehouse SQL endpoint)
  - FabricLink queries use `Sql.Database(FabricSQLEndpoint, FabricLakehouse, [Query="..."])` connector
  - Automatic JOINs to `OptionsetMetadata`, `GlobalOptionsetMetadata`, and `StatusMetadata` tables for human-readable choice/status labels
  - Separate handling of global vs. entity-specific optionsets
  - `INNER JOIN` for state/status metadata; `LEFT OUTER JOIN` for optional choice fields
  - Connection parameters stored as expressions in `expressions.tmdl`

- **Auto-Generated Fact Table Measures** — Two starter measures are automatically created on the fact table:
  - `{TableName} Count` — `COUNTROWS` for quick record counts
  - `Link to {TableName}` — Clickable URL to open records in Dataverse using `WEBURL` DAX function
  - Auto-generated measures are excluded from user measure preservation (they regenerate on each build)

- **Virtual Attribute Support** — Picklist/Boolean attributes now use actual virtual attribute names from metadata instead of assuming `{attributename}name` pattern
  - Handles edge cases like `donotsendmm` → `donotsendmarketingmaterial` (not `donotsendmmname`)
  - Global vs. entity-specific optionset detection for correct FabricLink metadata table JOINs

- **Language Code Parameter** — Builder now accepts a `languageCode` parameter (default 1033/English) for localizing metadata labels in FabricLink queries

### Changed

- **DataverseURL Architecture (TDS)** — DataverseURL is now stored as a hidden parameter *table* with `mode: import` and `IsParameterQuery=true` metadata (Enable Load pattern) instead of an expression
  - Resolves `KeyNotFoundException` that occurred during `CommonDataService.Database` refresh when DataverseURL was an expression
  - The parameter table pattern matches how Power BI Desktop natively handles Power Query parameters

- **DataverseURL Architecture (FabricLink)** — DataverseURL is now a hidden parameter *table* (not an expression in `expressions.tmdl`)
  - Both TDS and FabricLink now use identical DataverseURL table pattern for consistency
  - FabricLink `expressions.tmdl` contains only `FabricSQLEndpoint` and `FabricLakehouse` (DataverseURL moved to table)
  - Enables DAX measure references to work correctly in both connection modes

- **DAX Measure Table References** — Auto-generated measures now always use single-quoted table names: `'{displayName}'` instead of conditional quoting
  - Ensures consistent DAX syntax regardless of table name characters
  - Prevents syntax errors in measures when table names contain spaces or special characters

- **Money/Decimal Data Type Mapping** — Both TDS and FabricLink now map `money` and `decimal` types to `double` (matching Power BI Desktop's runtime behavior) to eliminate false "dataType changed" notifications on incremental rebuilds

- **Status/State Metadata JOINs (FabricLink)** — `statecode` uses `Base.statecode` (not `Base.statecodename`) and JOINs on `State` column (not `Option`); `statuscode` JOINs on both `State` and `Option` columns for correct label resolution

- **Stale Artifact Cleanup** — When switching between TDS and FabricLink modes, the builder now removes stale artifacts from the previous mode (e.g., removes `expressions.tmdl` when building TDS, removes `DataverseURL.tmdl` when building FabricLink)

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Column Generation** — Fixed bug where selecting both a lookup/choice ID field AND its virtual name column caused duplicate columns in TMDL
  - Example: Selecting `pbi_reportedbyid` and `pbi_reportedbyidname` no longer generates `pbi_reportedbyidname` twice
  - Applies to lookup name columns, choice/boolean label columns, and multi-select choice columns
  - All three generation methods (`GenerateTableTmdl`, `GenerateExpectedColumns`, `GenerateMQuery`) now check if synthesized name columns already exist before adding them
  - Prevents SQL query errors from duplicate column names in SELECT list

- Fixed `DataSource.Error` caused by virtual attribute name mismatch (e.g., `donotsendmmname` did not exist — actual name is `donotsendmarketingmaterial`)
- Fixed `KeyNotFoundException` during TDS model refresh by replacing expression-based DataverseURL with parameter table pattern
- Fixed false change detection on incremental rebuild where `double` columns were regenerated as `decimal`
- Fixed FabricLink `statuscode` label resolution to use compound JOIN on both `State + Option` columns

---

## [1.2026.2.47] - 2026-02-04
