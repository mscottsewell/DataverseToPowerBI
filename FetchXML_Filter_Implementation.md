# FetchXML View Filter Implementation

## Overview
The Dataverse Metadata Extractor now automatically converts FetchXML view filters to SQL WHERE clauses, applying them to the Power Query M expressions in your semantic model.

## What's Implemented

### Phase 1 - Current Support

#### Basic Comparison Operators
- `eq` → `=` (equals)
- `ne` → `<>` (not equals)
- `gt` → `>` (greater than)
- `ge` → `>=` (greater than or equal)
- `lt` → `<` (less than)
- `le` → `<=` (less than or equal)

#### Null Operators
- `null` → `IS NULL`
- `not-null` → `IS NOT NULL`

#### String Operators
- `like` → `LIKE`
- `not-like` → `NOT LIKE`
- `begins-with` → `LIKE 'value%'`
- `not-begin-with` → `NOT LIKE 'value%'`
- `ends-with` → `LIKE '%value'`
- `not-end-with` → `NOT LIKE '%value'`

#### Date Operators (Relative)
- `today` - Today's date
- `yesterday` - Yesterday
- `tomorrow` - Tomorrow
- `this-week` - Current week
- `last-week` - Previous week
- `next-week` - Next week
- `this-month` - Current month
- `last-month` - Previous month
- `next-month` - Next month
- `this-year` - Current year
- `last-year` - Previous year
- `next-year` - Next year

#### Date Comparison Operators
- `on` → Exact date match
- `on-or-after` → Greater than or equal
- `on-or-before` → Less than or equal

#### List Operators
- `in` → `IN (val1, val2, ...)`
- `not-in` → `NOT IN (val1, val2, ...)`

#### User Context Operators (TDS Only)
- `eq-userid` → `= CURRENT_USER` (⚠️ Not supported in FabricLink)
- `ne-userid` → `<> CURRENT_USER` (⚠️ Not supported in FabricLink)
- `eq-userteams` → Team membership check (⚠️ Not supported in FabricLink)
- `ne-userteams` → Negative team membership check (⚠️ Not supported in FabricLink)

> **Important:** Current user filters (`eq-userid`, `ne-userid`, `eq-userteams`, `ne-userteams`) are **only supported when using DataverseTDS connection mode**. These operators will be **skipped in FabricLink mode** because Direct Lake queries cannot use `CURRENT_USER` constructs. If you need row-level security based on current user, use TDS connection mode instead.

#### Complex Features
- ✅ Nested filter groups (`<filter type="and">` / `<filter type="or">`)
- ✅ Mixed AND/OR logic
- ⚠️ Link entities (logged as unsupported but main entity filters are applied)

## How It Works

### 1. View Selection
When you select a view for a table in the UI, the FetchXML is retrieved and stored with the table configuration.

### 2. Build Process
During semantic model build:
1. FetchXML is parsed for each table with a view
2. Filter conditions are converted to SQL
3. SQL is combined with existing filters (e.g., `statecode = 0`)
4. Results are embedded in the Power Query M expression

### 3. Visual Indicators
**In the UI:**
- View name appears in the "Filter" column
- `*` appears next to view name if filter is partially supported

**In the Semantic Model:**
- Table description shows: `"Filtered by view: [ViewName] *"`
- SQL comments document the filter in the M expression
- Comments list any unsupported features

### Example Output

```m
partition Position = m
    mode: directQuery
    source =
        let
            Dataverse = CommonDataService.Database(DataverseURL,[CreateNavigationProperties=false]),
            Source = Value.NativeQuery(Dataverse,"
            
            -- View Filter: Active Positions
            -- Filter: ((Base.statecode = 0) AND ((DATEPART(year, Base.createdon) = DATEPART(year, GETDATE())) OR (DATEPART(year, Base.createdon) = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE())))))
            
            SELECT Base.tov2_positionid
                  ,Base.tov2_positionnumber
                  ,Base.tov2_positionstatus
                  ...
            FROM tov2_position as Base
            WHERE (Base.statecode = 0) AND ((Base.statecode = 0) AND ((DATEPART(year, Base.createdon) = DATEPART(year, GETDATE())) OR (DATEPART(year, Base.createdon) = DATEPART(year, DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE())))))
            
            " ,null ,[EnableFolding=true])
        in
            Source
```

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Debug Logs
Every view filter conversion generates a detailed debug log in:
```
[OutputFolder]/FetchXML_Debug/[ViewName]_[Timestamp].txt
```

**Log Contents:**
- Input FetchXML (formatted)
- Conversion summary
- List of unsupported features
- Step-by-step processing log
- Final SQL WHERE clause

### Unsupported Feature Notifications
If a filter contains unsupported features:
1. A summary appears in the conversion result
2. The table description includes `*` marker
3. SQL comments list what wasn't translated
4. Debug log contains full details

### Common Issues

**Issue:** No filter applied despite selecting a view
- Check if view has any `<filter>` elements in FetchXML
- Verify FetchXML was retrieved (check debug log)

**Issue:** Partial filter applied
- Review debug log to see which operators were unsupported
- Check if link-entity filters were involved (not yet supported)

**Issue:** SQL syntax error in Power BI
- Check debug log for the generated SQL
- Verify attribute names match schema
- Report issue with debug log for investigation

**Issue:** Current user filter not applied (FabricLink mode)
- User context operators (`eq-userid`, `ne-userid`, `eq-userteams`, `ne-userteams`) are not supported in FabricLink
- Switch to DataverseTDS connection mode if row-level security based on current user is required
- Debug log will show "not supported in FabricLink (use TDS for current user filters)"

## Sharing Debug Information

To share a filter conversion issue:

1. Build your semantic model
2. Locate the debug file in `[OutputFolder]/FetchXML_Debug/`
3. Share the `[ViewName]_[Timestamp].txt` file
4. Include any Power BI error messages

**The debug file contains:**
- FetchXML input (sanitized of sensitive data)
- Conversion logic trace
- Generated SQL

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Support
- Link-entity filter translation
- Between operator
- Attribute-to-attribute comparisons

### Known Limitations
- **Current user filters not supported in FabricLink** - User context operators (`eq-userid`, `ne-userid`, `eq-userteams`, `ne-userteams`) only work with DataverseTDS connection mode
- Link-entity filters not supported (only main entity)
- No support for calculated values in conditions

## Testing Your Filters

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with a simple view filter
2. Build semantic model
3. Check table description for `*` marker
4. Review debug log if issues occur
5. Test in Power BI Desktop
6. Gradually add complexity

**Example Test Progression:**
1. Simple: `statecode = 0`
2. Add date: `createdon = this-year`
3. Add OR logic: `this-year OR last-year`
4. Add nested filters

## Technical Details

**Classes:**
- `FetchXmlToSqlConverter` - Core conversion logic
- Located in: `Services/FetchXmlToSqlConverter.cs`

**Integration Points:**
- `SemanticModelBuilder.GenerateTableTmdl()` - Applies filters during build
- `ExportTable.View` - Contains FetchXML for each table

**SQL Generation:**
- Uses `Base` as table alias
- Combines with existing WHERE conditions using AND
- Wraps complex conditions in parentheses
- Preserves operator precedence
