## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Open **XrmToolBox**
2. Go to **Tool Library** (Configuration → Tool Library)
3. Search for "**Dataverse to Power BI**"
4. Click **Install**
5. Restart XrmToolBox when prompted

### Creating Your First Model

#### Step 1: Connect to Your Environment

- In XrmToolBox, connect to your Dataverse environment
- Open the "**Dataverse to Power BI Semantic Model**" plugin

#### Step 2: Create or Select a Configuration

- Click **Semantic Model** to create a new configuration
- Give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Sales Analytics" or "Case Management")
- Set your **Working Folder** where the Power BI project will be saved

#### Step 3: Select Your Solution and tables

- Click **Select Tables** to open the solution and table picker
- **Choose your unmanaged solution** — this filters the list to tables relevant to your business app

> **Why solutions matter:** Dataverse contains hundreds of system tables. By selecting your solution first, you'll only see the tables your team has customized—making it much easier to find what you need.

#### Step 4: Choose your Fact Table

- Select your **Fact Table** to designate the central entity of your model
- Select the tables you want in your model from that solution

#### Step 5: Choose your Dimension Tables

- The tool will show all lookup relationships from your fact table
- Check which dimensions to include and activate the relationship where needed.
- Only one active relationship should exist between the Fact and a Dimension
- Optionally add "snowflake" parent dimensions if needed
- **Tip:** Start with a only a few tables to optimize performance.
- **Finish Selection** when you're done.

#### Step 6: Customize the Queries

- For each table, click the ✏️ icon to select a form and view
- The **form** determines which columns are selected by default to appear in your model
- The **view** determines which rows are included (filtering data to current data helps improve performance.)
- Check/Uncheck Attributes in the right column to include/exclude fields from the query.
- **Tip:** Start with a only the needed columns to optimize performance.
- Memo (text area) fields with lots of text are the slowest fields to retrieve - use sparingly.

#### Step 7: Add a Date Table (Recommended)

- Click **Dates** to configure your date dimension
- Select your primary date field (e.g., "Created On")
- Choose the year range for your date table
- Set the timezone adjustment to adjust the GMT date/time stored to a standardized timezone.
- Identify any other fields that you want standardized to the chosen timezone.

#### Step 8: Build Your Model

- Click **Build Semantic Model**
- Review the changes that will be made
- Click **Apply** to generate your Power BI project
- Once built, it will ask if you want to open the project.
- Start building your reports!

## 🛠️ Best Practices We Apply Automatically

This tool implements several Power BI best practices behind the scenes:

### 📝 Friendly Column Names

All columns are renamed from their logical names (like `cai_primarycontactid`) to their display names (like `Primary Contact`). This makes your reports much easier to understand and your field list cleaner to navigate.

### 🎯 Optimized Queries

We only include the columns you selected—no unnecessary data is pulled from Dataverse. This keeps your model lean and improves query performance.

### 🔍 View-Based Filtering

When you select a Dataverse view, its filter criteria are applied directly to the Power Query expression. This means only relevant rows are included (e.g., "Active Accounts Only" or "My Open Cases").

> **Important:** If the view definition changes in Dataverse, your Power BI model won't automatically update. You'll need to run this tool again to refresh the model's metadata and pick up the new view filters.

### 🔗 Referential Integrity

For required lookup fields (where a value must be provided), we enable "Assume Referential Integrity" on relationships. This allows Power BI to use more efficient INNER JOIN operations instead of OUTER JOINs.

### 📅 Date Handling

DateTime fields are converted to Date-only values with proper timezone adjustment. Dataverse stores all dates in UTC, but your reports need local dates for accurate daily analysis. We apply the timezone offset you specify so "January 15th" means January 15th in *your* timezone.

### ↔️ Relationship Cardinality

All relationships are correctly configured as Many-to-One from fact to dimension tables, with proper cross-filter direction for optimal DAX performance.

### 🏷️ Hidden Technical Columns

Primary key columns (like `accountid`) are included for relationships but hidden from the report view. This keeps your field list clean while maintaining proper data model structure.

### 📊 Auto-Generated Measures

For your fact table, the tool automatically creates two starter measures:

- **{TableName} Count** — `COUNTROWS` of the fact table for quick record counts
- **Link to {TableName}** — A clickable URL that opens each record directly in Dataverse, using the `WEBURL` DAX function

These measures are regenerated on each build. Your own custom measures are always preserved.

## 🔌 Connection Modes: TDS vs FabricLink

This tool supports two different connection modes for accessing Dataverse data. Your choice affects how queries are generated and how the semantic model connects to your data.

### Dataverse TDS (Default)

Uses the **Dataverse TDS Endpoint** — a SQL-compatible interface built directly into Dataverse.

| Aspect | Detail |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Connector** | `CommonDataService.Database` |
| **Query Style** | Native SQL via `Value.NativeQuery(...)` with `[EnableFolding=true]` |
| **Best For** | Direct Dataverse access without Fabric infrastructure |
| **Requirements** | TDS endpoint enabled in your Dataverse environment |

### FabricLink

Uses **Microsoft Fabric Link for Dataverse** — data is synced to a Fabric Lakehouse and queried via the Fabric SQL endpoint.

| Aspect | Detail |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Connector** | `Sql.Database(FabricSQLEndpoint, FabricLakehouse)` |
| **Query Style** | Standard SQL queries with metadata JOINs for display names |
| **Best For** | Large datasets, advanced analytics, when Fabric is already in use |
| **Requirements** | Fabric workspace with Dataverse Link configured |

> **FabricLink queries** automatically JOIN to `OptionsetMetadata` / `GlobalOptionsetMetadata` and `StatusMetadata` tables for human-readable choice labels and status values. TDS mode uses virtual "name" attributes for the same purpose.

## 🚢 Publishing and Deployment

### Publishing to Power BI Service

1. Open your `.pbip` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Sign in to your Power BI account
3. Click **Publish** in the Home ribbon
4. Select your destination workspace
5. Wait for the upload to complete

Your semantic model (dataset) and report are now available in the cloud!

### Configuring DirectQuery Authentication

For DirectQuery models connected to Dataverse, you must configure authentication so each report viewer uses their own identity:

1. Go to [Power BI Service](https://app.powerbi.com)
2. Navigate to your **Workspace**
3. Find your **semantic model** (shown with a database icon)
4. Click the **three dots (...)** → **Settings**
5. Expand **Data source credentials**
6. Click **Edit credentials**
7. Set Authentication method to **OAuth2**
8. ✅ **Enable: "Report viewers can only access this data source with their own Power BI identities"**
9. Click **Sign in** and authenticate

This critical setting ensures:

- Each user's Dataverse security roles are respected
- Users only see records they have permission to view
- No shared service account is used

### Setting Up Scheduled Refresh (Import/Dual Models)

If you've switched any tables to Import or Dual mode:

1. In Power BI Service, go to your semantic model **Settings**
2. Expand **Scheduled refresh**
3. Toggle **Keep your data up to date** to On
4. Set your refresh frequency (e.g., daily at 6 AM)
5. Configure failure notifications

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I add more tables after the initial build?

**A:** Yes! Run the tool again, select additional tables, and rebuild. Your existing customizations (measures, formatting, hierarchies) will be preserved.

### Q: What happens if our Dataverse schema changes?

**A:** The tool will detect changes when you run it again. It shows you a preview of what's new, modified, or removed before applying updates—you're always in control.

### Q: Can I use this with Dynamics 365 apps?

**A:** Absolutely! This works with any Dataverse environment, including Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and custom Power Apps. It supports both the Dataverse TDS endpoint and FabricLink connections.

### Q: Why are some of my columns missing?

**A:** Columns are pre-selected by default from your selected form. If a field isn't on the form, it won't pre-selected to be in the model by default. You can add columns that aren't on the form by switching to view "All" attributes and checking the selection box beside any additional ones you need.

### Q: How do I handle many-to-many relationships?

**A:** The tool creates standard many-to-one relationships. For many-to-many
scenarios (like Contacts associated with multiple Accounts), you may need to
include the intersection table and create a bridge pattern manually. These can
become complex and require more expertise in proper modeling to ensure your
results are reflective of your intent.

### Q: My report is slow—what can I do?

**A:** See our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for detailed optimization steps.

### Q: Can I version control my Power BI project?

**A:** Yes! The PBIP format is designed for Git. Each table, relationship, and report element is a separate text file that shows meaningful changes in version control.
