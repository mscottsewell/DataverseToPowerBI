## 📊 Understanding Star-Schema Design

This tool guides you into building a **star-schema** data model, which is the recommended design pattern for Power BI. Understanding this concept will help you build better reports.

### What is a Star-Schema?

A star-schema organizes your data into two types of tables:

**Fact Tables** (the center of the star ⭐)
- Contains your transactional or event data
- Examples: Orders, Opportunities, Cases, Appointments
- Has many rows that grow over time
- Contains the numbers you want to analyze (amounts, quantities, counts)

**Dimension Tables** (the points of the star)
- Contains descriptive attributes for filtering and grouping
- Examples: Customers, Products, Employees, Territories
- Changes less frequently
- Provides the "who, what, where, when" context for your facts

### Why Star-Schema Matters

- ✅ **Faster Performance** — Power BI's engine is optimized for this pattern  
- ✅ **Simpler DAX** — Calculations are easier to write and understand  
- ✅ **Intuitive Filtering** — Filters flow naturally from dimensions to facts  
- ✅ **Smaller Model Size** — Less data duplication than flat tables

### A Note About Snowflake Schemas

Sometimes a dimension table has its own lookup to another table (for example, Customer → Territory → Region). This creates a "snowflake" pattern where dimensions branch into sub-dimensions.

⚠️ **Be cautious with snowflaking:**
- Each additional level adds complexity
- Filters must travel through more relationships
- Performance can degrade with deep hierarchies

**Our recommendation:** Keep your schema as flat as possible. Only add parent dimensions when you truly need to filter or group by those attributes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Open **XrmToolBox**
2. Go to **Tool Library** (Configuration → Tool Library)
3. Search for "**Dataverse to Power BI**"
4. Click **Install**
5. Restart XrmToolBox when prompted

### Creating Your First Model

#### Step 1: Connect to Your Environment
- In XrmToolBox, connect to your Dataverse environment
- Open the "**Dataverse to Power BI Semantic Model**" plugin

#### Step 2: Create or Select a Configuration
- Click **Semantic Model** to create a new configuration
- Give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Sales Analytics" or "Case Management")
- Set your **Working Folder** where the Power BI project will be saved

#### Step 3: Select Your Solution and tables
- Click **Select Tables** to open the solution and table picker
- **Choose your unmanaged solution** — this filters the list to tables relevant to your business app
> **Why solutions matter:** Dataverse contains hundreds of system tables. By selecting your solution first, you'll only see the tables your team has customized—making it much easier to find what you need.

#### Step 4: Choose your Fact Table
- Select your **Fact Table** to designate the central entity of your model
- Select the tables you want in your model from that solution

#### Step 5: Choose your Dimension Tables
- The tool will show all lookup relationships from your fact table
- Check which dimensions to include and activate the relationship where needed.
- Only one active relationship should exist between the Fact and a Dimension
- Optionally add "snowflake" parent dimensions if needed
- **Tip:** Start with a only a few tables to optimize performance.
- **Finish Selection** when you're done.

#### Step 6: Customize the Queries
- For each table, click the ✏️ icon to select a form and view
- The **form** determines which columns are selected by default to appear in your model
- The **view** determines which rows are included (filtering data to current data helps improve performance.)
- Check/Uncheck Attributes in the right column to include/exclude fields from the query.
- **Tip:** Start with a only the needed columns to optimize performance.
- Memo (text area) fields with lots of text are the slowest fields to retrieve - use sparingly.

#### Step 7: Add a Date Table (Recommended)
- Click **Dates** to configure your date dimension
- Select your primary date field (e.g., "Created On")
- Choose the year range for your date table
- Set the timezone adjustment to adjust the GMT date/time stored to a standardized timezone.
- Identify any other fields that you want standardized to the chosen timezone.

#### Step 8: Build Your Model
- Click **Build Semantic Model**
- Review the changes that will be made
- Click **Apply** to generate your Power BI project
- Once built, it will ask if you want to open the project.
- Start building your reports!

## 🛠️ Best Practices We Apply Automatically

This tool implements several Power BI best practices behind the scenes:

### 📝 Friendly Column Names
All columns are renamed from their logical names (like `cai_primarycontactid`) to their display names (like `Primary Contact`). This makes your reports much easier to understand and your field list cleaner to navigate.

### 🎯 Optimized Queries
We only include the columns you selected—no unnecessary data is pulled from Dataverse. This keeps your model lean and improves query performance.

### 🔍 View-Based Filtering
When you select a Dataverse view, its filter criteria are applied directly to the Power Query expression. This means only relevant rows are included (e.g., "Active Accounts Only" or "My Open Cases").

> **Important:** If the view definition changes in Dataverse, your Power BI model won't automatically update. You'll need to run this tool again to refresh the model's metadata and pick up the new view filters.

### 🔗 Referential Integrity
For required lookup fields (where a value must be provided), we enable "Assume Referential Integrity" on relationships. This allows Power BI to use more efficient INNER JOIN operations instead of OUTER JOINs.

### 📅 Date Handling
DateTime fields are converted to Date-only values with proper timezone adjustment. Dataverse stores all dates in UTC, but your reports need local dates for accurate daily analysis. We apply the timezone offset you specify so "January 15th" means January 15th in *your* timezone.

### ↔️ Relationship Cardinality
All relationships are correctly configured as Many-to-One from fact to dimension tables, with proper cross-filter direction for optimal DAX performance.

### 🏷️ Hidden Technical Columns
Primary key columns (like `accountid`) are included for relationships but hidden from the report view. This keeps your field list clean while maintaining proper data model structure.

### 📊 Auto-Generated Measures
For your fact table, the tool automatically creates two starter measures:

- **{TableName} Count** — `COUNTROWS` of the fact table for quick record counts
- **Link to {TableName}** — A clickable URL that opens each record directly in Dataverse, using the `WEBURL` DAX function

These measures are regenerated on each build. Your own custom measures are always preserved.

---

## 📁 Understanding Your Generated Project

The project creates a **Power BI Project (PBIP)** which is a format that allows for editing, change management and collaboration. - A PBIP can be saved as a PBIX file for distribution by simply clicking save-as and choosing the PBIX format.

The tool creates a PBIP folder structure. The exact layout depends on your connection mode:

### Dataverse TDS Mode (Default)

```
YourModelName/
├── YourModelName.pbip              ← Open this file in Power BI Desktop
├── YourModelName.SemanticModel/
│   └── definition/
│       ├── model.tmdl              ← Model configuration and table references
│       ├── relationships.tmdl      ← Table relationships
│       └── tables/                 ← Individual table definitions
│           ├── DataverseURL.tmdl   ← Hidden parameter table (connection URL)
│           ├── Date.tmdl           ← Calendar dimension (if configured)
│           ├── Account.tmdl
│           └── Contact.tmdl ...
└── YourModelName.Report/
    └── (report definition files)
```

### FabricLink Mode

```
YourModelName/
├── YourModelName.pbip              ← Open this file in Power BI Desktop
├── YourModelName.SemanticModel/
│   └── definition/
│       ├── model.tmdl              ← Model configuration and expression references
│       ├── expressions.tmdl        ← DataverseURL, FabricSQLEndpoint, FabricLakehouse
│       ├── relationships.tmdl      ← Table relationships
│       └── tables/                 ← Individual table definitions
│           ├── Date.tmdl           ← Calendar dimension (if configured)
│           ├── Account.tmdl
│           └── Contact.tmdl ...
└── YourModelName.Report/
    └── (report definition files)
```

> **Key difference:** In TDS mode, the Dataverse URL is stored as a hidden parameter *table* (`DataverseURL.tmdl`) — this is required for Power BI Desktop to properly resolve the `CommonDataService.Database` connector. In FabricLink mode, connection details are stored as *expressions* in `expressions.tmdl`.

The PBIP format is a folder-based project that's perfect for:
- Version control with Git
- Collaboration with other developers
- Seeing exactly what changed between versions

## 🔌 Connection Modes: TDS vs FabricLink

This tool supports two different connection modes for accessing Dataverse data. Your choice affects how queries are generated and how the semantic model connects to your data.

### Dataverse TDS (Default)

Uses the **Dataverse TDS Endpoint** — a SQL-compatible interface built directly into Dataverse.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Connector** | `CommonDataService.Database` |
| **Query Style** | Native SQL via `Value.NativeQuery(...)` with `[EnableFolding=true]` |
| **Best For** | Direct Dataverse access without Fabric infrastructure |
| **Requirements** | TDS endpoint enabled in your Dataverse environment |

### FabricLink

Uses **Microsoft Fabric Link for Dataverse** — data is synced to a Fabric Lakehouse and queried via the Fabric SQL endpoint.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Connector** | `Sql.Database(FabricSQLEndpoint, FabricLakehouse)` |
| **Query Style** | Standard SQL queries with metadata JOINs for display names |
| **Best For** | Large datasets, advanced analytics, when Fabric is already in use |
| **Requirements** | Fabric workspace with Dataverse Link configured |

> **FabricLink queries** automatically JOIN to `OptionsetMetadata` / `GlobalOptionsetMetadata` and `StatusMetadata` tables for human-readable choice labels and status values. TDS mode uses virtual "name" attributes for the same purpose.

---

## ⚡ Direct Query vs. Import Mode

Your generated model uses **DirectQuery** by default. Here's what that means and how to choose the right mode for your needs.

### DirectQuery Mode (Default)

**How it works:** Every time you interact with your report, Power BI sends a query to Dataverse and retrieves fresh data.

| ✅ Advantages | ⚠️ Considerations |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Always shows the latest data | Slower interactivity (1-5 second delays) |
| Respects Dataverse row-level security | Some DAX functions not available |
| No scheduled refresh needed | Subject to Dataverse API limits |
| Smaller .pbix file size | Complex calculations may timeout |
| Users see only their permitted data | Best with fewer concurrent users |

**Best for:**
- Real-time operational dashboards  
- Security-sensitive data where each user should only see their records
- Data that changes frequently throughout the day
- Queries that reference 'Current_User' in the filter (e.g. "My Opportunities")

### Import Mode

**How it works:** Data is copied into the Power BI file and stored in memory. Reports query this in-memory cache.

| ✅ Advantages | ⚠️ Considerations |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Blazing fast interactivity | Data must be refreshed regularly |
| Full DAX functionality | Requires scheduled refresh (up to 8x/day) |
| Works offline | Larger file sizes |
| No per-query API limits | Security must be applied at report level (RLS) |
| Handles many concurrent users | Dataverse security not automatic |

**Best for:**
- Historical trend analysis
- Complex calculations requiring full DAX
- Published reports with many users
- Executive dashboards refreshed daily

### Dual Mode (The Best of Both Worlds)

You can use **different storage modes for different tables**—this is often the optimal approach:

- Keep your large, frequently-changing **fact table in DirectQuery**
- Import smaller, stable **dimension tables** for fast filtering

| ✅ Advantages | ⚠️ Considerations |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Fast dimension filtering and slicing | Requires refresh schedule for dimensions |
| Always-current fact data | Slightly more complex to configure |
| Efficient for large fact tables | Must plan which tables to import |
| Reduces Dataverse API calls | |

**To switch a table to Import mode:**
1. Open your model in Power BI Desktop
2. Go to **Model** view
3. Select the table you want to change
4. In the **Properties** pane, change **Storage mode** from "DirectQuery" to "Import"
5. Configure a refresh schedule when you publish to Power BI Service

> **Please Note** that any table that was built with a view that referenced the **current user** will need to be updated to use a different view/filter.

## 🚢 Publishing and Deployment

### Publishing to Power BI Service

1. Open your `.pbip` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Sign in to your Power BI account
3. Click **Publish** in the Home ribbon
4. Select your destination workspace
5. Wait for the upload to complete

Your semantic model (dataset) and report are now available in the cloud!

### Configuring DirectQuery Authentication

For DirectQuery models connected to Dataverse, you must configure authentication so each report viewer uses their own identity:

1. Go to [Power BI Service](https://app.powerbi.com)
2. Navigate to your **Workspace**
3. Find your **semantic model** (shown with a database icon)
4. Click the **three dots (...)** → **Settings**
5. Expand **Data source credentials**
6. Click **Edit credentials**
7. Set Authentication method to **OAuth2**
8. ✅ **Enable: "Report viewers can only access this data source with their own Power BI identities"**
9. Click **Sign in** and authenticate

This critical setting ensures:
- Each user's Dataverse security roles are respected
- Users only see records they have permission to view
- No shared service account is used

### Setting Up Scheduled Refresh (Import/Dual Models)

If you've switched any tables to Import or Dual mode:

1. In Power BI Service, go to your semantic model **Settings**
2. Expand **Scheduled refresh**
3. Toggle **Keep your data up to date** to On
4. Set your refresh frequency (e.g., daily at 6 AM)
5. Configure failure notifications

## 📈 Suggested Next Steps

Once you've built and opened your model in Power BI Desktop, here are recommended enhancements:

### 1. Create Key Measures
The tool auto-generates a record count and URL link measure on your fact table. Build on those with your own business metrics:
```dax
Total Revenue = SUM(Orders[Amount])
Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Order Count])
Win Rate = DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Opportunities, Opportunities[Status] = "Won")),
    COUNTROWS(Opportunities)
)
```

### 2. Build Hierarchies
Create drill-down paths in your dimension tables:
- **Date:** Year → Quarter → Month → Week → Day
- **Geography:** Country → State/Province → City
- **Organization:** Business Unit → Team → Owner

### 3. Apply Any Additional Formatting Desired

### 4. Hide Technical Columns
By default, this utility follows the best practice of hiding columns that end users don't need:
- GUID/ID columns (like `accountid`)
- They are kept in the model for relationships, but hidden from report view
- If you find that you have additional values that are only needed for formulas, you can hide them as well.

### 5. Create a Model Documentation Page
Add a report page that shows:
- Your data model diagram
- Key measure definitions
- Data refresh information
- Known limitations

### 6. Consider Row-Level Security (for Import Mode)
If using Import mode, implement RLS to control data access:
1. Go to **Modeling** → **Manage roles**
2. Create roles that filter data based on user context
3. Assign users to roles in Power BI Service

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I add more tables after the initial build?
**A:** Yes! Run the tool again, select additional tables, and rebuild. Your existing customizations (measures, formatting, hierarchies) will be preserved.

### Q: What happens if our Dataverse schema changes?
**A:** The tool will detect changes when you run it again. It shows you a preview of what's new, modified, or removed before applying updates—you're always in control.

### Q: Can I use this with Dynamics 365 apps?
**A:** Absolutely! This works with any Dataverse environment, including Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and custom Power Apps. It supports both the Dataverse TDS endpoint and FabricLink connections.

### Q: Why are some of my columns missing?
**A:** Columns are pre-selected by default from your selected form. If a field isn't on the form, it won't pre-selected to be in the model by default. You can add columns that aren't on the form by switching to view "All" attributes and checking the selection box beside any additional ones you need.

### Q: How do I handle many-to-many relationships?
**A:** The tool creates standard many-to-one relationships. For many-to-many
scenarios (like Contacts associated with multiple Accounts), you may need to
include the intersection table and create a bridge pattern manually. These can
become complex and require more expertise in proper modeling to ensure your
results are reflective of your intent.

### Q: My report is slow—what can I do?
**A:** Try these optimizations:
1. Reduce the number of columns (only include what you need)
2. Remove long text fields such as text area fields.
3. Use view more aggressive filters to limit rows to only those typically relevant to the user.
4. Switch dimension tables to Dual mode
5. Simplify visuals (fewer visuals per page)
6. Use aggregations for large fact tables
7. For larger datasets, moving the fact table to Import Mode will make the interaction more responsive.
8. Filtering on large Date Ranges using a Direct Query source with the Date Table can cause timeouts based on the way the query is constructed. You may want to apply the query to the date field directly from within the query pane rather than relying on the Date Table.

### Q: Can I version control my Power BI project?
**A:** Yes! The PBIP format is designed for Git. Each table, relationship, and report element is a separate text file that shows meaningful changes in version control.
